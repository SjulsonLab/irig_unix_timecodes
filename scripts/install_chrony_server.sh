# Install and configure chrony + gpsd on a Raspberry Pi with a GPS timing receiver.
#
# This script sets up GPS-disciplined NTP serving:
#   - gpsd reads NMEA data from the GPS serial port and exposes PPS
#   - chrony uses gpsd shared memory (SHM 0) for coarse GPS time and
#     PPS (/dev/pps0) for sub-microsecond accuracy
#   - Pool servers provide fallback if GPS is unavailable
#
# After installation, the RPi becomes a stratum 1 NTP server that other
# machines on the network can sync to.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Raspberry Pi with a GPS receiver connected to serial UART
#   - PPS output from GPS wired to GPIO 4 (default) with pps-gpio overlay enabled
#   - Serial console disabled (raspi-config -> Interface -> Serial -> No console, Yes hardware)
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./install_chrony_server.sh [--serial-device /dev/ttyAMA0]
